## The Problem

**130+ Americans die every day** from opioid overdoses. Many of these deaths are preventable if naloxone is administered within minutes. But:

- Victims often use alone
- Bystanders don't know how to help
- Naloxone isn't available when needed
- Emergency services arrive too late

## The Solution: NarcoGuard NG2

The **NarcoGuard 2 (NG2)** is a revolutionary smartwatch that **automatically detects overdoses and deploys naloxone** — no human intervention required.

### How It Works

1. **24/7 Monitoring** - Advanced sensors track heart rate, blood oxygen, respiratory rate, and movement
2. **AI Detection** - Kalman filtering algorithms identify overdose patterns in real-time
3. **Auto-Injection** - When overdose is detected, 4mg naloxone deploys automatically in under 3 seconds
4. **Emergency Alert** - Simultaneously contacts 911, emergency contacts, and nearby trained Heroes
5. **AR Guidance** - If a bystander arrives, the app provides step-by-step CPR and naloxone instructions
