## Campaign Story (Copy this to GoFundMe)

### The Story

**My name is Stephen Blanford, and I'm a recovering addict who has lost too many friends to overdose.**

Every 5 minutes, someone in America dies from an opioid overdose. In my hometown of Binghamton, New York, I've watched this crisis destroy families, including my own. I've been to too many funerals. I've made too many "I'm sorry for your loss" calls.

**But I refuse to just watch anymore. I built something that can actually save lives.**

### What is NarcoGuard?

NarcoGuard is a revolutionary smartwatch system I've spent years developing. It's not just another app - it's a complete life-saving system:

**The NG2 Watch:**
- Monitors vital signs 24/7 (heart rate, blood oxygen, breathing)
- Uses AI to detect overdose within seconds
- **AUTOMATICALLY INJECTS NALOXONE** - no human intervention needed
- Alerts 911, family, and nearby trained responders
- Works even if you're alone

**The App (FREE - try it now at narcoguard.app):**
- Emergency SOS button
- Hero Network - connects trained responders in your area
- Guardian AI - personalized support and resources
- AR-guided CPR and naloxone training
- 24/7 recovery resources and hotlines

### Why Broome County?

Broome County has one of the highest overdose rates in New York State. In recent years, over 150 people have died from overdoses here - mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, friends.

**These are not statistics. These are people I knew. People you might have known too.**

### The Goal: 80 Watches = 80 Lives Protected

I'm raising $24,584 to build and distribute **80 NarcoGuard NG2 watches completely FREE** to at-risk individuals in Broome County.

**Cost Breakdown:**
- $262.30 - Watch hardware and sensors
- $45.00 - Naloxone cartridge
- **$307.30 per watch**
- **$24,584 total for 80 watches**

### Where Does Your Money Go?

**100% goes to watch production and distribution.**
- I'm not taking a salary
- No administrative costs
- No marketing fees
- Every dollar = saving lives

### Why I Built This

I've been clean for years, but I remember the fear. Using alone, knowing that one bad batch could be my last. Wishing someone was there to save me if something went wrong.

**The NG2 watch IS that someone.**

It doesn't judge. It doesn't sleep. It doesn't give up on you. It just saves your life.
